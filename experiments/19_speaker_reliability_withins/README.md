Normalized mean responses on 100%/all slider by block (column), quantifier (row), and trial type (color). Drunk/court are unreliable/uncooperative, sober is reliable. Clear effect of speaker reliability on "some", but values still not super high (normalization issue).

Raw mean responses on 100%/all slider by block (column), quantifier (row), and trial type (color). Drunk/court are unreliable/uncooperative, sober is reliable. Very clear effect of speaker reliability on "some", and for the first time, values approaching 1 in the unreliable case. This has never happened before!
